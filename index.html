          It was Christmas Eve, 1995. I was 7 years old, and full of the usual
          excitement and anticipation every child has at that time of year. The
          90s was a great era for toys; it was the decade that saw the release
          of icons like the Tamagotchi, Furby and Beanie Babies, among others.
          But the toy of my dreams in 1995 was the
          <strong>Playmobil mansion</strong> - a large build-your-own Victorian
          style house with an open cross-section at the back with rooms to
          furnish to your heart's content, right down to the cutlery. Playmobil,
          much like Lego, was all the rage at the time, famous for its
          collection of model buildings and figurines which you had to build
          yourself from scratch with the help of a trusty instruction manual (no
          Youtube tutorials to help us in those days!). Having grown up in
          London, a Victorian mansion was the kind of place I'd dreamt of living
          in back then.

          Restless with excitement that Christmas night, I found myself unable
          to sleep. I was of an age where I went along with the 'Father
          Christmas' story, but suspected Mum & Dad to be his agents of action.
          So when I heard shuffling around and mumbling downstairs, I couldn't
          help but wonder what they were up to. So I did what I imagine every
          kid would do; I snuck downstairs to have a snoop - excuse ready
          at-hand of course, just in case I was caught in the act! At the base
          of the stairs, I noticed the door to the living room was ajar and it
          seemed the action was coming from within. I heard the rustle of
          papers, clicking of plastic, and huffing and puffing of two tired
          parents trying to assemble something as discreetly as possible in the
          dead of night. Leaning closer I saw it; my dream house, coming to life
          before my very eyes on the living room floor. Feeling the rushing
          thrill of ecstacy that comes with knowing what waits for you on
          Christmas morning, I rushed back upstairs, hoping I hadn't been found
          out and waited to for my magic moment to come.

          There were many things that made this toy special for me. First of
          all, it was a space in which I could dream and imagine - where I could
          play at being grown-up, having a space arranged in the way I would
          want it to be and imagining all the possible things that could happen
          in that space. For a creative child like myself I valued these moments
          so much. But most of all what I cherished most about that toy was the
          love and effort I saw put into it by my parents that Christmas night.
          I look back now, and while I may not have shown it at the time, I feel
          incredibly grateful to have been in the position to receive such a
          toy, put together with such care and attention. While the mansion
          eventually went on to a new home to bring other children joy, I'll
          forever remember it and everything it represented about my childhood
          and the magic of dreams coming true at Christmas.
