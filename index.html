          It was Christmas Eve, 1995. I was 7 years old, and full of the usual
          excitement and anticipation every child has at that time of year. The
          90s was a great era for toys; it was the decade that saw the release
          of icons like the Tamagotchi, Furby and Beanie Babies, among others.
          But the toy of my dreams in 1995 was the Playmobil mansion - a large
          build-your-own Victorian style house with an open cross-section at the
          back with rooms which you could furnish to your heart's content, right
          down to the cutlery. Playmobil, much like Lego, was all the rage at
          the time, famous for its collection of model buildings and figurines
          which you had to build yourself from scratch with the help of a trusty
          instruction manual (no Youtube tutorials to help us in those days!).
          Having grown up in London, a Victorian mansion was the kind of place
          I'd dreamt of living in back then.Up in my bedroom that Christmas
          night, restless with excitement, I found myself unable to sleep.

          I was of an age where I went along with the 'Father Christmas' story,
          but I suspected Mum & Dad to be his agents of action. So when I heard
          shuffling around and mumbling downstairs, I couldn't help but wonder
          what they were up to down there. And so I did what I imagine every kid
          has done at some point; I snuck downstairs to have a snoop - excuse
          ready at-hand of course, just in case I was caught in the act! At the
          base of the stairs, I noticed the door to the living room was ajar and
          it seemed the action was coming from within. I heard the rustle of
          papers, clicking of plastic, and huffing and puffing of two tired
          parents trying to assemble something as discreetly as possible in the
          dead of night. Leaning closer I saw it; my dream house, coming to life
          before my very eyes on the living room floor. Feeling the rushing
          thrill of ecstacy that comes with knowing what waits for on Christmas
          morning, I rushed back upstairs, hoping I hadn't been found out and
          waited to for my magic moment to come.

          There were many things that made this toy special for me. First of
          all, it was a space in which I could dream and imagine - where I could
          play at being grown-up, having a space arranged in the way I would
          want it to be and imagining all the possible things that could happen
          in that space. For a creative child like myself I valued these moments
          so much. But most of all what I cherished most about that toy was the
          love and effort I saw put into it by my parents that Christmas night.
          I look back now and while I may not have shown it at the time, I feel
          incredibly grateful to have been in the position to receive such a
          toy, put together with such care and attention. While the mansion went
          on to a new home to bring other children joy, I'll forever remember it
          and everything it represented about my childhood and the magic of
          dreams coming true at Christmas.
